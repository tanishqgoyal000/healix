# Medicine Expiry Tracking App

## Overview
This project is a mobile application developed using Flutter in Android Studio to help pharmacies and medical stores track medicine expiry dates. The app uses OCR and barcode scanning to automatically extract information from medicine packages and notifies users about upcoming expirations.

The project was developed as part of a startup idea during the BITSpreneur Hackathon.
